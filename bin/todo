# I've used literally every todo list, app, program, script, everything. Even
# the ones you are building and haven't released yet.
#
# I've found that they're all nice in their nice ways, but I still don't use
# them, thus defeating the purpose of a todo list.
#
# All `todo` does is put a file in ~/.todos.d with the filename given. That's
# it. I aggressively prune my todos of old tasks and keep one or two on there
# at a time. Once I've finished a todo, I just delete the file. That's it.
